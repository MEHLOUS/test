Lemon8's focus on photo-sharing, brand advertising, and selling an aesthetic closely resembles Instagram's interface and its influencers' posting habits. However, a significant difference between Lemon8 and Instagram is that Lemon8 doesn't have a verification system yet. Lemon8 is prepping for an official launch in May, when it can be assumed that more prominent names in the social media industry will debut on the app, creating a need for verifying users. The most significant difference between Lemon8 and Instagram is that Lemon8 is just new and fresh for social media users. Many of us have been on Instagram as early as 2010, and it's worn a lot of new faces, each failing to dazzle existing users. TikTok created a new generation of social media celebrities, and maybe Lemon8 will do the same thing. Do you plan to start a Lemon8 profile? Let us know in the comments.",
